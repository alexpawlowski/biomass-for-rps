## Solid Biomass

Solid Biomass resource contains information compiled in the 50 U.S. states as compiled by NREL in 2014 using the most recent data available collected by the USDA, Forest Service's Timber Product Output Database (2012). Units below are in dry tonnes / yr. The descriptions are from the dataset reproduced here for clarity.

- CropRes

  This field illustrates the harvesting crop residues from corn, wheat, soybeans, cotton, sorghum, barley, oats, rice, rye, canola, dry edible beans, peanuts, safflower, sunflower, sugarcane, and flaxseed by county. The crop residues are estimated using total crop production (data from USDA 2012 Census), crop to residue ratio, and moisture content. It is assumed that only 35% of the total residue could be collected as biomass. The remaining portion is to be left on the field to maintain ecological and agricultural functions. 

- UrbanWood

  This field illustrates the urban wood waste by county - wood material from MSW (wood chips and pallets), utility tree trimming and/or private tree companies, and construction and demolition sites.

- SecMill

  This field contains data for secondary mill residues by county (wood scraps and sawdust from woodworking shops â€” furniture factories, wood container and pallet mills, and wholesale lumberyards).

- ForestRes

  This category includes logging residues and other removable material left after carrying out silviculture operations and site conversions. Logging residue comprises unused portions of trees, cut or killed by logging and left in the woods. Other removables are the unutilized wood volume of trees cut or otherwise killed by cultural operations (e.g. pre-commercial thinnings) or land-clearings to non-forest uses. This data illustrates 65% of logging residues and 50% of other removals which is the portion that could be collected as biomass. The remaining portion is to be left on the field to maintain ecological functions.

- PrimMill

  This field contains data on primary mill residues by county. Primary mill residues include wood materials (coarse and fine) and bark generated at manufacturing plants (primary wood-using mills) when round wood products are processed into primary wood products, such as slabs, edgings, trimmings, sawdust, veneer clippings and cores, and pulp screenings. This data illustrates the total amount of primary mill residues (used and unused) by county. Note that most of this resource is currently utilized.
